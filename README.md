# ECE 211 - Fall 2024: WiFi Weather Display with ESP32

This repository contains the code and resources for the **WiFi Weather Display** project, developed by a team of ECE 211 in Fall 2024.

## Project Overview
The **WiFi Weather Display** uses an ESP32 microcontroller to connect to an online API and fetch real-time weather data, specifically temperature. The temperature is then displayed on a 4-digit 7-segment display, and an RGB LED changes color based on the temperature range.

### Features
- **Real-Time Temperature Display**: Fetches and displays temperature data from an online API using the ESP32's WiFi capabilities.
- **Color-Coded Temperature Indicator**: An RGB LED changes color to indicate different temperature ranges.

## Components Used
- **ESP32 Development Board**
- **4-Digit 7-Segment Display**
- **74HC595 shift register**
- **RGB LED**
- **WiFi Connectivity for API Access**
